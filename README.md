## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

**_Issue-O-Matic_** is an open source project issue management software.

It helps bootstrapping developers and SMB project teams acquire developer & customer feedback and track implementation progress through QA & UAT stages as well as post-production.

Primary benefits include:

1. No IT knowledge required to use
2. Turn-key implementation ready
3. Free of charge

Project management and feedback implementation are hard and expensive. Simplify it.
